## Project Description, Manual, Meeting Minutes and Tests

Look at our [Wiki-Page](https://github.zhaw.ch/kuendkun/PM3-HS20-IT19a_ZH-Team4/wiki) for more information.

## Branching and Git-Workflow
Generally, we work on feature branches which we later merge into the `dev` branch. After testing and making sure everything runs correctly we merge the `dev` branch
into the `master` branch.
The naming-convention for feature branches is the following: `feature/<optional-issue-nr>-foo-bar`
